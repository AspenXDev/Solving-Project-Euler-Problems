      Let's solve another problem from

    </h2>
    <h3>Problem Number: 002</h3>
    <h4><b>Problem Title: Even Fibonacci Numbers</b></h4>
    <p>
      Problem Definition: Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated
      by adding the previous two terms.<br />By starting with 1 and 2, the first
      terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Problem Question: </b>Find the sum of the even-valued Fibonacci numbers
      whose values do not exceed four million.

      As a non-CS student, I was also introduced to the concept of recursive
      algorithms.<br />
      A function calling itself and updating its variables till its time to stop
      fascinated me because long codes are not necessary.<br />

    <button id="sumEvenFibonacciRecursive">Calculate Recursively</button>
    <p>Answer: <span id="result02"></span></p>
    <p>
      The recursive method took us
      <span id="executionTime02">--</span> ms

      Let's not stop there; Could there actually be more?<br />
      True enough, we can observe that every third Fibonacci number is even.<br />
      The sequence of even Fibonacci numbers follows a pattern:<br />
      2, 8, 34, 144, 610, ...<br /><br />
      Using this pattern, we can generate only even Fibonacci numbers
      directly.<br />
      ie. We can use the sliding window technique to find each new Fibonacci
      number as 4 times of the second term plus the first term and slide it
      along.

    <p>Answer: <span id="result03"></span></p>
    <p>
      While taking less memory, it took:
      <span id="executionTime03">--</span> ms

        Try the algorithms here using a higher ceiling so the processing time
        gets more pronounced too.
