      <br><b>Explanation of the algorithm used:</b></br>
<div class="Explanation"><pre>   Start with the smallest prime factor, 2:
            If the number is divisible by 2 (i.e., even),
            divide it by 2 repeatedly until it’s no longer divisible by 2.
            This removes all factors of 2.
    
            Check odd numbers starting from 3:
                After removing factors of 2,
                the remaining number must be odd.
                So, start checking odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 9, etc.) as potential factors.
    
            For each odd number, keep dividing the number by it until it’s no longer divisible.
            This removes all factors of that number.
    
            Stop when the factor is greater than the square root of the remaining number:
                If the remaining number becomes smaller than the factor we're checking,
                there’s no need to check any larger numbers.
                The largest factor left is the largest prime factor.
    
            If there’s anything left:
                If the number left after dividing by smaller factors is greater than 1,
                it’s itself a prime factor and the largest one.</pre>
