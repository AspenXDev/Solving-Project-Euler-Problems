# Solving Project Euler Problems

This repository contains solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems.
The solutions are written in **JavaScript** and **Python** to demonstrate my skills in both languages.

## Folder Structure

- `JavaScript/`: Contains all the solutions to the Project Euler problems written in JavaScript.
- `Python/`: Here I've stored all the solutions  written in Python.
- `Java/`: This folder is where I've practiced writing Java methods to the solutions.
- 
## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (for general problem-solving and later transition to ServiceNow)
- Python (for efficient algorithm development and problem-solving)
- Java because of the fullstack development SCTP that I am attending
- HTML and CSS are used for frontend presentation
