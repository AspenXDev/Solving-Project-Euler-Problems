# Welcome!

## My name is Victor Chan, and I will journal my Project Euler problem-solving journey here.

## Table of Contents

1. [My GitHub Profile](https://github.com/AspenXDev)
2. [Solutions in JavaScript](https://github.com/AspenXDev/Solving-Project-Euler-Problems/tree/master/JavaScript)
3. [Solutions in Python](https://github.com/AspenXDev/Solving-Project-Euler-Problems/tree/master/Python)

As yet, these are the problems from Project Euler that I have solved:
